# Building blocks

When building a custom modal, you can use these components to ensure
that your modal will look the same as other modals.

The palette of building blocks will expand in the future.

### ModalContainer

This component ensures that the modal is full height when switching
to full screen on mobile phones.

When you make a modal component, this should be the root.
Everything else should be placed inside of ModalContainer.

If you are making a modal that is never full screen, this is not needed.
Instead, you can use `ModalBody` as root.

### ModalHeading

This is a default heading for modals.

### ModalHeader

This is a default header for modals. It includes `ModalHeading`,
but might include more things in the future. A close button for example.

Should be placed in `ModalBody`.

### ModalBody

This component adds default padding. If you need something to reach the edge
of the modal, a `SeparatorLine` for example, don't wrap it with `ModalBody`.

It also adds a default gap between all children.

Most content should be wrapped with `ModalBody`.

### ModalFooter

This is a footer for modals. It can be made sticky.
It will be glued to the bottom of the modal, with no padding under it.
So if the modal is higher than the content, the footer will be at
the bottom of the modal, not immediately after the content.

This should be outside of `ModalBody`.

### ModalActionButtons

This component takes buttons as prop, and places them in a row on
desktop and iPads, but in a column on phones.

This should be placed inside `ModalBody`.

#### Custom modal example

```tsx
export const CustomModal: React.FC<CustomModalProps> = ({ heading, text }) => {
  return (
    <ModalContainer>
      <ModalBody
        flexDirection={"column"}
        alignItems={"center"}
        maxWidth={maxWidth}
        minWidth={minWidth}
      >
        <ModalHeader heading={heading} />
        {text && <Text textAlign={"center"}>{text}</Text>}
      </ModalBody>
    <ModalContainer>
  );
};
```

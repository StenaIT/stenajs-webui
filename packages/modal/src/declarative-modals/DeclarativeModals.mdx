# Declarative modals

Declarative modals are React components with `isOpen={true}` prop.
They are controlled by passing state and callbacks.

If you can trigger the modal with a function (such as when user clicks a button, or a mutation onCompleted),
you should use `useModalDialog` hooks instead.

# Minimal inherent visuals

Visually, these are identical to dialog hooks API.
They provide:

- Dark overlay
- Shadow around the modal
- White background
- Round borders

Everything else has to be provided in `children`.
Either use one of the ready-made modals, or create a custom modal in your app.

## Variants

There is a collection of modal variants.

### Modal

This is the normal modal.
It sizes itself as per content, unless on mobile. On mobile it is fullscreen.

This is usable when you want to prevent user input while some job is in progress.

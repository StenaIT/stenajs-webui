# Ready-made modals

There is a collection of ready-made modals.
To use them, just pass them as `children` to the modal.

If you create custom modals, you can check the source if these for inspiration.

Currently there is only one ready-made modal.
There will be more in the future.

### InfoAlert

This is intended for alerts, such as "Session has expired" and similar.

```tsx
<Modal isOpen={open} onRequestClose={close}>
  <InfoAlert
    minWidth={"384px"}
    heading={heading}
    text={text}
    icon={stenaBell}
    buttons={
      <PrimaryButton
        size={"larger"}
        label={"Close"}
        onClick={() => setOpen(false)}
      />
    }
  />
</Modal>
```

<Canvas of={InfoAlertStories.OneButton} />

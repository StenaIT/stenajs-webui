# Modals

This package contains everything needed to add modals to your app.

It contains 4 categories:

- Declarative modals
- Dialog modals
- Building-blocks
- Ready-made modals

Let's go over them.

# Modals

## Declarative modals

Declarative modals are React components with `isOpen={true}` prop.

These components receive state and callbacks as props and are controlled.

If you can trigger the modal with a function (such as when user clicks a button, or a mutation onCompleted),
you should use dialog modals instead.

## Dialog modals

Dialog modals use the `<dialog>` element and the dialog-API available in the browser.
It is imperative, which means that you the modal by calling a function, not as a reaction by state change.

## Minimal inherent visuals

Visually, declarative and dialog models are identical.

They provide:

- Dark overlay
- Shadow around the modal
- White background
- Round borders

Everything else has to be provided in `children`.
Either use one of the ready-made modals, or create a custom modal in your app.

# Help components

These are components that help you create the content of a modal, and make sure
that it looks consistent throughout your and other apps.

## Building blocks

These are small UI components that help ensure that, for example, a heading
in modals look the same in all modals.

## Ready-made modals

If you have a common use-case, for example a "Session has expired" modal,
you can use these ready-made modal components.

They are complete and ready to use.

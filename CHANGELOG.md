#### `Popover`

`Popover` now uses Tippy, and Tippy's props. This means that some props have changed.

them using local state and the Popover `visible` props.

## 1.2.0

### New features

- `entity-list-reducer` has new action `actionOnAll`, which applies child action to all items.
- New reducer factory `editable-entity-reducer` which contains persisted and editable instances of entity.

## 1.1.1

### Hotfix

- Fix focus on DateRangeInput when moving from start date to end date.

## 1.1.0

### Breaking changes

- No longer clearing `StandardTable` state when new data is fetched.

This caused prefilled checkboxes to be cleared.

This must now be handled manually when there is new data in the table without it being unmounted between renders.

- DateRangeInput now allows invalid date range.

Previously, it would switch start date and end date if start date was after end date. Instead, it now highlights the
inputs with error highlight.

This means that you are no longer guaranteed that the range is valid.

## 1.0.8

### Bug fix

onChange did not properly use latest value in editor cells.

## 1.0.7

### Hotfix

`reducerIdGate` did not handle actions with unexpected form. Such actions can be dispatched by Redux itself, or
middlewares. Such actions are now just passed down to the internal reducer, which can handle the actions as they see
fit.

## 1.0.6

#### Redux package types updated

It now uses type `Reducer` type from `redux` instead of `react`. This makes it compatible with `combineReducers` from
Redux.

## 1.0.5

### Improvements

- `Select` component now has the same focused box shadow that is used in input fields.
- `Link` component now uses an 1px outline instead of border.
- `StandardTableConfig` now infers column names from row object automatically.
- `StandardTableConfig` now supports expand collapse button in header row (set `showHeaderExpandCollapse` to `true`)

#### New actions for `StandardTable`

`StandardTable` is now using new higher order reducers, which require composing nested actions. This made it harder to
create actions in the apps, and these new actions help.

- selectByIds(ids)
- clearSelection()
- expandByIds(ids)
- collapseAll()
- sortBy(columnId, desc?)
- clearSortOrder()

New actions are exposed by `useLocalStateTableContext` hook, and can be created manually
using `createStandardTableActions` function.

### Breaking changes

- New actions are breaking, if the app is using them via `useLocalStateTableContext`.
- `useLocalStateTableContext` now accepts an `initialState` parameter instead of `initialSortOrder`
  and `initialSortOrderDesc`.
  - Use `createStandardTableInitialState` to maintain compatibility.

## 1.0.4

### Improvements

- `Collapsible` now has `autoFocus` and `innerRef` properties.
- `PrimaryButton` now has an `as` property to allow it to be rendered as an anchor instead of a button. This also
  affects `SecondaryButton` and `FlatButton`.
- `CollapsibleClickableContent` now passes its remaining properties to its `Clickable`.
- `@types/react-modal` has been bumped to allow setting an `id` property to the modal element.

### Fixes

- `Chip` close button negative margin of 1px removed.
- `Checkbox`'s :after pseudo element now uses box-sizing: content-box by default. This fixes an issue where in the case
  where all pseudo elements globally is set to use something other than content-box, resulted in a too small checkmark.
- `Space` now doesn't flex, making it keep its size in a flexbox context.
- `ModalHeader` now uses the primary font.

## 1.0.3

### Breaking changes

#### Changes to reducer factories.

All reducer factories have been updated to no longer accept reducerId. The reason for this is the new reducerIdGate
higher order reducer.

Compose with `reducerIdGate` to get same functionality, and use `reducerIdGateAction` to create actions.

### New features

- Add higher order reducers `recordObjectReducer` and `reducerIdGate`.

### Bug fixes

- NavBar in a Column would expand the NavBar to be higher than 50px.

## 1.0.2

### New features

- Add support for center content in NavBar

## 1.0.1

### Improvements

#### useGridNavigation/useGridCell hook

- Now has new setting, `edgeMode`, which defines how to behave when user tries to navigate outside of table.

#### StandardTable has new options.

- tableId can now be set, but is optional.
- rowIndexOffset and colIndexOffset.
- Now possible to navigate between tables, when combining edgeMode, shared tableId and index offsets.
- initialSortOrder.
- disableSorting. Disables onClicks on table heads, only initialSortOrder is applied.

## 1.0.0

### Changes

- DateRangePicker now has an arrow between fields, instead of text "to".

### Fixes

## 1.0.0-alpha.2

### Bug fixes

- TextInput onChange and onKeyDown props no longer overwrite internal handlers.

changed. `onKeyDown` now always receives all key down events.

## 1.0.0-alpha.1

- Hover and focus combined with variants in `TextInput` have been updated according to design system.
